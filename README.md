# Build an Angular2 application as follows:


- Show a random Flickr image at the center of the screen.

- Images should be obtained from the Flickr public RSS feed.

- Image should be presented along with its title, description and date taken.

- A button will allow the user to refresh and get a new image.

- If button is not pressed the image refreshes by itself every 5 seconds.

- The same image may not be displayed twice.

- Assignment should be committed to github


## Work will be evaluated based on the following:


1. Angular2 application structure (components, services, etc.)

2. Code quality

3. Aesthetics
